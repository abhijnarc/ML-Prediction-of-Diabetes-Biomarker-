# ML-Prediction-of-Diabetes-Biomarker-
This project investigated the potential of machine learning in complementing established 
techniques for identifying key genes involved in Type 2 Diabetes, a condition with a complex 
genetic background.
 DGE analysis showed significant dysregulation in 746 out of 18,484 
genes. Machine learning models, specifically SVM, RF, LR, and XGBoost were evaluated on 
the RNA-Seq count dataset. The decision tree-based algorithm XGBoost outperformed other 
classifiers and SHAP analysis of this model helped identify top key genes.
